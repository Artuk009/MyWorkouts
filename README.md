# MyWorkouts-InProgress

# Accomplished So Far
In this project, I'm attempting to create a workout app for myself that allows me to record individual exercises along with their rep and set counts.
The project utilizes navigation component for efficiently transitioning between fragments and uses a sign up and sign in page for the user to sign up for
and sign into their account. This is achieved utilizing Firebase Authentication, standard login layouts, and associated logic. After the user has loged in, 
the application navigates to the home_fragment where the user can add, edit, and delete workouts from a displayd list. The list is achieved through the use
of pop up card views that have their logic implemented in a seperate fragment.

# To Be Accomplished
Next, I plan to add drawerLayout from the Navigation Component documentation page, so that I may seperate the workouts into individual days based on muscle
groups trained in each exerscise. Additionally, I will add logout functionality, user permissions based on account status, as well as Bottom Navigation Bar
that is a staple for most Android layouts these days.
